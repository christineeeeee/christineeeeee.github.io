Like everything in the world, the launch of Quibi was deeply affected by the COVID-19. Maybe in Jeffrey&amp;rsquo;s plan, there would be a huge ceremony to announce the birth of Quibi, however, nowadays, with the process of quarantine, any pre-plan seemed in vain. Boldly but not surprisingly, like he refused to produce the Beta version of this app to let a small portion of potential consumers to test it first with $1 billion funding, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the founder of Quibi, decided to not delay the launch of this app.</description>

As I was looking through Weibo(the most popular social platform in China, like Twitter), I noticed one of my friend&amp;rsquo;s weibo saying that she was pretty upset because her Duolingo English Proficiency Test&amp;rsquo;s result was invalid again. This was her third time taking Duolingo Test and for the first and the second time, the result was cancelled, too.
